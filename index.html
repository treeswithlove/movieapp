                <h5 class="summaryText">
                    The film tells the story of Moana, the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a Polynesian village,
                    who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with a goddess. When a blight strikes
                    her island, Moana sets sail in search of Maui, a legendary demigod, in the hope of returning the
                    heart of Te Fiti and saving her people. On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship
                    the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean, using a pounamu stone as her heart and the
                    source of her power. Maui, the shapeshifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give
                    humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who
                    seeks the heart: Te Kā, a volcanic demon. In the fight, Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both
                    his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths of the sea.
                    A millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to
                    Te Fiti. However, Tui arrives and takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Moana's
                    mother, Sina, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's
                    chief. Years later, a blight strikes the island, rotting the coconuts and dwindling the number of
                    fish caught. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is
                    happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and
                    is shipwrecked back on Motunui.
                    Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cave where a number of ships are hidden, revealing to
                    Moana that their people used to be voyagers, but they stopped when Maui stole Te Fiti's heart
                    because the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning
                    the island, but it can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti,
                    which she gives to Moana. Shortly afterward, Tala falls ill and while on her death bed, tells Moana
                    that she must begin her journey.-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moana_(2016_film)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
